# Speech-To-Text-Recognition
During meetings, important discussions and decisions are often manually documented by a note-taker, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. The aim of this project was to develop a system that can automatically transcribe speech into text in real time and provide a concise summary of key points discussed.
